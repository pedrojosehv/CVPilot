Dear Fourvenues Recruitment Team,

My data-driven approach to product optimization aligns perfectly with your need for a Product Analyst.  My experience in defining KPIs and using A/B testing to improve user flows directly translates to enhancing purchasing processes.

Leading the redesign of a billing model (SaaS), I leveraged SQL and Tableau to analyze user behavior, identifying friction points in the checkout funnel.  This resulted in a 15% increase in conversion rates and a 10% reduction in customer support tickets.  Agile methodologies ensured rapid iteration and stakeholder alignment.

This data-driven, iterative approach, proven to deliver quantifiable results, will directly benefit Fourvenues by optimizing your purchase flows and boosting efficiency.  My proficiency in SQL, Tableau, and A/B testing makes me confident in exceeding expectations.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Pedro Herrera
