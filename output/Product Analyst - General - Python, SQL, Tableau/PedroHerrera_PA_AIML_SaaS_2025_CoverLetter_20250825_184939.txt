Dear Fourvenues Recruitment Team,

My experience in product strategy and A/B testing aligns perfectly with your Product Analyst role.  I excel at data-driven decision-making, translating insights into actionable improvements.

For a SaaS accounting platform (Noddok), I led user research, defining key performance indicators (KPIs) for user onboarding.  This resulted in a 15% increase in activation rates by streamlining the user flow from initial signup to first transaction, directly impacting product delivery.  Engineering handoff was seamless due to detailed documentation.

This rigorous, data-informed approach translates directly to optimizing Fourvenues' purchase flows and configurations, driving significant improvements in key metrics and enhancing user experience.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Pedro Herrera
