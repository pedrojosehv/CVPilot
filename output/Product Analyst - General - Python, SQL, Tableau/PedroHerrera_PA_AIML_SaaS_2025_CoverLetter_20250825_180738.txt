Dear Fourvenues Recruitment Team,

My data-driven approach to product optimization, honed through experience in A/B testing and funnel analysis, aligns perfectly with your Product Analyst role.  I excel at translating complex data into actionable strategies.

For a mobile app (Compartaxi), I managed the entire product lifecycle, from user flow design to market launch.  Using SQL and Tableau, I analyzed user behavior, identifying bottlenecks in the onboarding process.  A redesigned flow increased conversion by 15%, boosting new user acquisition.

This data-driven approach, focusing on measurable improvements and streamlined user journeys, ensures I can significantly contribute to optimizing Fourvenues' purchase flows and configurations, delivering tangible results.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Pedro Herrera
