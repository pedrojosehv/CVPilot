Dear Fourvenues Recruitment Team,

My data-driven approach to product development, honed through successful A/B testing and KPI definition, aligns perfectly with your Product Analyst role.  I excel at translating user insights into actionable strategies.

For a SaaS accounting platform (Noddok), I streamlined the user onboarding flow.  Through user research and iterative testing, I reduced customer churn by 15% and increased activation rates by 20%, directly impacting user engagement.  This involved close collaboration with engineering, ensuring seamless handoff and timely product delivery.

This experience demonstrates my ability to deliver data-backed improvements to product performance, directly contributing to Fourvenues' optimization goals.  My proficiency in Tableau, Power BI, and Google Analytics ensures insightful analysis and effective communication of findings.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Pedro Herrera
