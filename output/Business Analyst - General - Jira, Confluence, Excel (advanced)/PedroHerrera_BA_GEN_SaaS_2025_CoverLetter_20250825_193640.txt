Dear Sollers Recruitment Team,

My proven ability to translate complex business needs into actionable solutions aligns perfectly with your Business Analyst role.  My agile approach, honed through numerous successful product development cycles, ensures efficient delivery and stakeholder satisfaction.

Leading the redesign of a billing model, I leveraged UX optimization and strategic business analysis.  This resulted in a 20% improvement in user engagement and a 15% reduction in support tickets, significantly boosting efficiency and customer satisfaction.  My proficiency in data analysis (SQL, Excel) facilitated data-driven decision-making throughout the process.

This experience demonstrates my capacity to deliver tangible results within a product-focused environment, mirroring the requirements of this role at Sollers.  I'm confident my skills in stakeholder management and agile methodologies will contribute significantly to your team's success.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Pedro Herrera
