Dear Reverse Tech Recruitment Team,

I'm a Product Manager with 5+ years' experience driving SaaS revenue growth and operational excellence. My expertise in product strategy, data analytics, and cross-functional leadership aligns perfectly with this Growth Product Manager role.  I consistently deliver results exceeding expectations.

In a previous role, I spearheaded a campaign that optimized the user onboarding funnel. This resulted in a 25% increase in conversion rates within three months, directly impacting revenue growth.  My approach involved A/B testing multiple variations of the onboarding flow, leveraging data from Google Analytics and Tableau to identify and address friction points.

I'm confident my skills in product strategy, A/B testing, data analysis (using Google Analytics, Tableau, and Power BI), and cross-functional collaboration will significantly contribute to Reverse Tech's continued success.  My proven ability to drive revenue growth makes me an ideal candidate.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Pedro Herrera
